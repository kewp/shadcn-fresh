# shadcn-fresh

this library is an attempt to port shadcn/ui over
to fresh.

## background

this library is basically a fork of https://github.com/nikogoli/testing-shadcn-ui-in-fresh
but also using https://github.com/netzo/netzo to figure
out how to make it work as a library.

## getting started

to see how to use it go to https://github.com/kewp/shadcn-fresh-example
but basically:

1. create a fresh project
2. import `shadcn-fresh`
3. prosper

> still figuring this all out ... tailwind isn't working properly.
